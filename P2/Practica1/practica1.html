        <br></br>
        Sunrise with you on my chest</br>
        No blinds in the place where I live</br>
        Daybreak open your eyes</br>
        'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night</br>
        Still, we're changing our minds here</br>
        Be yours, be my dear</br>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">

        <br>So close with you on my lips
        <br>Touch noses, feelin' your breath
        <br>Push your heart and pull away, yeah
        <br>Be my summer in a winter day, love
        <br>I can't see one thing wrong
        <br>Between the both of us
        <br>Be mine, be mine, yeah
        <br>Anytime, anytime
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <br>Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while
        <br>Haven't I? I thought I knew it all
        <br>Found love but I was wrong
        <br>More times than enough
        <br>But since you came along
        <br>I'm thinking
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <br>Baby, you (yeah)
        <br>Are bringing out a different kind of me
        <br>There's no safety net that's underneath, I'm free
        <br>Fallin' all in you
        <br>Fell for men who weren't how they appeared, yeah
        <br>Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here, we're free
        <br>Fallin' all in you
    </p>    
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <br>Fast forward a couple years, yeah
        <br>Grown up in the place that we live
        <br>Make love, then we fight
        <br>Laugh 'cause it was only meant to be for one night, baby
        <br>I guess we can't control
        <br>What's just not up to us
        <br>Be mine, be mine, yeah
        <br>Anytime, anytime
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">

    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <br>Every time I see you baby I get lost
        <br>If I'm dreaming, baby, please don't wake me up
        <br>Every night I'm with you I fall more in love
        <br>Now I'm laying by your side
        <br>Everything feels right since you came along
        <br>I'm thinking
